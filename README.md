# MIT Distributed Lab(6.824 $\rightarrow$ 6.5840)

This repo is based on [MIT Spring 2024 Course and Lab](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/)

- [x] Lab1: Map Reduce
    - pass all tests with `-race`
    - use `commit` call to promise server/client exit moment right
    - workers scalable
- [x] Lab2: Key/Value Server
    - tests are extremely strict(for codes and machine), check [this article](https://juejin.cn/post/7332852200937898035), it may help a lot if you are stuck in memory and time overhead
